# RevertCore
.NET Core port of Revert libraries

Large portions of the Mathematics project are ported from Java to C# and taken from Libgdx
https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx

Specifically, the Interpolation class and most subclasses, the Circle, Rectangle, and Polygon Classes, and the Vector / Vector2 Classes.

The WordNet and FrameNet projects are ported from Matt Gerber of Michgan State University.  High praise for his work.  I can't find a direct source link anymore though.  If anyone has it, I'll gladly include it.
