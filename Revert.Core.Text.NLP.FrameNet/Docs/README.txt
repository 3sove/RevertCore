COMPILING

1) The FrameNet API depends on some libraries that are distributed
   separately. To get them, perform a Subversion checkout from the
   following URL:

   https://ptl.sys.virginia.edu/msg8u/NLP/Libraries/Public

2) Right-click on the FrameNet project, select "Properties", and go to
   "Build". Change "Output path" to the Public directory that was
   checked out in the previous step. Check the box next to "XML
   documentation file".

3) Right-click on the FrameNet project and select "Build".

USE

See the test application.

LIMITATIONS

The API has been tested on FrameNet versions 1.3 and 1.5. I have no
idea if it will work with other versions of the data.

BUGS

None that I know of, but if you find any please contact me at
